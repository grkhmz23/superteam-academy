Indexing Solana starts with understanding where data lives and how to extract structured events from raw chain data. Unlike EVM chains where events are explicit log topics, Solana encodes program state changes in account updates and program logs. Your indexer must parse these sources and transform them into a queryable event stream.

A transaction on Solana contains one or more instructions. Each instruction targets a program, includes account metas, and carries opaque instruction data. When executed, programs emit log entries via solana_program::msg or similar macros. These logs, combined with pre/post account states, form the raw material for event indexing.

The indexer pipeline typically follows: fetch → parse → normalize → store. Fetch retrieves transaction metadata via RPC or geyser plugins. Parse extracts program logs and account diffs. Normalize converts raw data into domain-specific events with stable schemas. Store persists events with appropriate indexing for queries.

Key concepts for normalization: instruction program IDs identify which decoder to apply, account ownership determines data layout, and log prefixes often indicate event types (e.g., "Transfer", "Mint", "Burn"). Your indexer must handle multiple program versions gracefully, maintaining backward compatibility as instruction layouts evolve.

Idempotency is critical. Block reorganizations are rare on Solana but possible during forks. Your indexing pipeline should handle replayed transactions without duplicating events. This typically means using transaction signatures as unique keys and implementing upsert semantics in the storage layer.

## Operator mental model

Treat your indexer as a data product with explicit contracts:
1. ingest contract (what raw inputs are accepted),
2. normalization contract (stable event schema),
3. serving contract (what query consumers can rely on).

When these contracts are versioned and documented, protocol upgrades become manageable instead of breaking downstream analytics unexpectedly.

## Checklist
- Understand transaction → instructions → logs hierarchy
- Identify program IDs and account ownership for data layout selection
- Normalize raw logs into domain events with stable schemas
- Implement idempotent ingestion using transaction signatures
- Plan for program version evolution in decoders

## Red flags
- Parsing logs without validating program IDs
- Assuming fixed account ordering across program versions
- Missing idempotency leading to duplicate events
- Storing raw data without normalized event extraction

  content: `# Token account decoding and SPL layout

SPL Token accounts follow a standardized binary layout that indexers must parse to track balances and mint operations. Understanding this layout enables you to extract meaningful data from raw account bytes without relying on external APIs.

A token account contains: mint address (32 bytes), owner address (32 bytes), amount (8 bytes u64), delegate (32 bytes, optional), state (1 byte), is_native (1 byte + 8 bytes if native), delegated_amount (8 bytes), and close_authority (36 bytes optional). The total size is typically 165 bytes for standard accounts.

Account discriminators help identify account types. SPL Token accounts are owned by the Token Program (TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA) or Token-2022. Your indexer should verify ownership before attempting to parse, as malicious accounts could mimic data layouts.

Decoding involves: read the 32-byte mint, verify it matches expected token, read the 64-bit amount (little-endian), convert to decimal representation using mint decimals, and track owner for balance aggregation. Always handle malformed data gracefully - truncated accounts or unexpected sizes should not crash the indexer.

For balance diffs, compare pre-transaction and post-transaction states. A transfer emits no explicit event but changes two account amounts. Your indexer must detect these changes by comparing states before and after instruction execution.

## Checklist
- Verify token program ownership before parsing
- Decode mint, owner, and amount fields correctly
- Handle little-endian u64 conversion properly
- Support both Token and Token-2022 programs
- Implement graceful handling for malformed accounts

## Red flags
- Parsing without ownership verification
- Ignoring mint decimals in amount conversion
- Assuming fixed account sizes without bounds checking
- Missing balance diff detection for transfers

  content: `# Transaction meta parsing: logs, errors, and inner instructions

Transaction metadata provides the context needed to index complex operations. Understanding how to parse logs, handle errors, and traverse inner instructions enables comprehensive event extraction.

Program logs follow a hierarchical structure. The outermost logs show instruction execution order, while inner logs reveal CPI calls. Each log line typically includes a prefix indicating severity or type: "Program", "Invoke", "Success", "Fail", or custom program messages. Your parser should handle nested invocation levels correctly.

Error handling distinguishes between transaction-level failures and instruction-level failures. A transaction may succeed overall while individual instructions fail (and are rolled back). Conversely, a single failing instruction can cause the entire transaction to fail. Indexers should record these distinctions for accurate analytics.

Inner instructions reveal the complete execution trace. When a program makes CPI calls, these appear as inner instructions in transaction metadata. Indexers must traverse both top-level and inner instructions to capture all state changes. This is especially important for protocols like Jupiter that route through multiple DEXs.

Log filtering improves efficiency. Rather than parsing all logs, indexers can filter by program ID prefixes or known event signatures. However, be cautious - aggressive filtering might miss important events during protocol upgrades or edge cases.

## Checklist
- Parse program logs with proper nesting level tracking
- Distinguish transaction-level from instruction-level errors
- Traverse inner instructions for complete CPI traces
- Implement efficient log filtering by program ID
- Handle both success and failure scenarios

## Red flags
- Ignoring inner instructions and missing CPI events
- Treating all log failures as transaction failures
- Parsing without log level/depth context
- Missing error context in indexed events

  content: `# Pagination, checkpointing, and caching semantics

Production indexers must handle large datasets efficiently while maintaining consistency. Pagination, checkpointing, and caching form the backbone of scalable indexing infrastructure.

Pagination strategies depend on query patterns. Cursor-based pagination using transaction signatures provides stable ordering even during concurrent writes. Offset-based pagination can miss or duplicate entries during high-write periods. For time-series data, consider partitioning by slot or block time.

Checkpointing enables recovery from failures. Indexers should periodically save their processing position (last processed slot/signature) to durable storage. On restart, resume from the checkpoint rather than re-indexing from genesis. This pattern is essential for long-running indexers handling months of chain history.

Caching reduces redundant RPC calls. Account metadata, program IDs, and decoded instruction layouts can be cached with appropriate TTLs. However, cache invalidation is critical - stale cache entries can lead to incorrect decoding or missed events. Consider using slot-based versioning for cache entries.

Idempotent writes prevent data corruption. Even with checkpointing, duplicate processing can occur during retries. Use transaction signatures as unique identifiers and implement upsert semantics. Database constraints or unique indexes should enforce this at the storage layer.

## Checklist
- Implement cursor-based pagination for stable ordering
- Save periodic checkpoints for failure recovery
- Cache account metadata with slot-based invalidation
- Enforce idempotent writes via unique constraints
- Handle backfills without duplicating events

## Red flags
- Using offset pagination for high-write datasets
- Missing checkpointing requiring full re-index on restart
- Caching without proper invalidation strategies
- Allowing duplicate events from retry logic

  content: `# Analytics aggregation: per wallet, per token metrics

Raw event data becomes valuable through aggregation. Building analytics pipelines enables insights into user behavior, token flows, and protocol usage patterns.

Per-wallet analytics track individual user activity. Key metrics include: transaction count, unique tokens held, total volume transferred, first/last activity timestamps, and interaction patterns with specific programs. These metrics power user segmentation and engagement analysis.

Per-token analytics track asset-level metrics. Important aggregations include: total transfer volume, unique holders, holder distribution (whales vs retail), velocity (average time between transfers), and cross-program usage. These inform tokenomics analysis and market research.

Time-windowed aggregations support trend analysis. Daily, weekly, and monthly rollups enable comparison across time periods. Consider using tumbling windows for fixed periods or sliding windows for moving averages. Materialized views can pre-compute common aggregations for query performance.

Normalization ensures consistent comparisons. Convert all amounts to human-readable decimals, normalize timestamps to UTC, and use consistent address formatting (base58). Deduplicate events from failed transactions that may still appear in logs.

## Checklist

- Normalize amounts, timestamps, and addresses
- Exclude failed transactions from aggregates
