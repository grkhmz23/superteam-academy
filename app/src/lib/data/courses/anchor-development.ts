Anchor is best understood as a contract between three layers that must agree on shape: your Rust handlers, generated interface metadata (IDL), and client-side instruction builders. In raw Solana programs you manually decode bytes, manually validate accounts, and manually return compact error numbers. Anchor keeps the same runtime model but moves repetitive work into declarations. You still define security-critical behavior, yet you do it through explicit account structs, constraints, and typed instruction arguments.

The ` + "`#[program]`" + ` module is where instruction handlers live. Each function gets a typed ` + "`Context<T>`" + ` plus explicit arguments. The corresponding ` + "`#[derive(Accounts)]`" + ` struct tells Anchor exactly what accounts must be provided and what checks happen before handler logic executes. This includes signer requirements, mutability, PDA seed verification, ownership checks, and relational checks like ` + "`has_one`" + `. If validation fails, the transaction aborts before touching your business logic.

IDL is the bridge that makes the developer experience consistent across Rust and TypeScript. It describes instruction names, args, accounts, events, and custom errors. Clients can generate typed methods from that shape, reducing drift between frontend code and on-chain interfaces. When teams ship fast, drift is a common failure mode: wrong account ordering, stale discriminators, or stale arg names. IDL-driven clients make those mistakes less likely.

Provider and wallet concepts complete the flow. The provider wraps an RPC connection plus signer abstraction and commitment preferences. It does not replace wallet security, but it centralizes transaction send/confirm behavior and test setup. In practice, production reliability comes from understanding this boundary: Anchor helps with ergonomics and consistency, but you still own protocol invariants, account design, and threat modeling.

For this course, treat Anchor as a typed instruction framework on top of Solana’s explicit account runtime. That framing lets you reason clearly about what is generated, what remains your responsibility, and how to test deterministic pieces without needing devnet in CI.

## What Anchor gives you vs what it does not

Anchor gives you: typed account contexts, standardized serialization, structured errors, and IDL-driven client ergonomics. Anchor does not give you: automatic business safety, correct authority design, or threat modeling. Those are still protocol engineering decisions.

## By the end of this lesson

- You can explain the Rust handler -> IDL -> client flow without hand-waving.
- You can identify which checks belong in account constraints versus handler logic.
- You can debug IDL drift issues (wrong account order, stale args, stale client bindings).

  content: `# Accounts, constraints, and safety

Most serious Solana vulnerabilities come from account validation mistakes, not from arithmetic. Anchor’s constraint system exists to turn those checks into declarative, auditable rules. You declare intent in the account context, and the framework enforces it before instruction logic runs. This means your handlers can focus on state transitions while constraints guard the perimeter.

Start with core markers: ` + "`Signer<'info>`" + ` proves signature authority, and ` + "`#[account(mut)]`" + ` declares state can change. Forgetting ` + "`mut`" + ` produces runtime failures because Solana locks account writability up front. This is not cosmetic metadata; it is part of execution scheduling and safety. Then ownership checks ensure an account belongs to the expected program. If a malicious user passes an account that has the same bytes but wrong owner, strong ownership constraints stop account substitution attacks.

PDA constraints with ` + "`seeds`" + ` and ` + "`bump`" + ` verify deterministic account identity. Instead of trusting a user-provided address, you define the derivation recipe and compare runtime inputs against it. This pattern prevents attackers from redirecting logic to arbitrary writable accounts. ` + "`has_one`" + ` links account relationships, such as enforcing ` + "`counter.authority == authority.key()`" + `. That relation check is simple but high leverage: it prevents privileged actions from being executed by unrelated signers.

Anchor also supports custom ` + "`constraint = ...`" + ` expressions for protocol invariants, like minimum collateral or authority domain rules. Use these sparingly but deliberately: put invariant checks near account definitions when they are structural, and keep business flow checks in handlers when they depend on instruction arguments or prior state.

A practical review checklist: verify every mutable account has an explicit reason to be mutable; verify every signer is necessary; verify every PDA seed recipe is stable and versioned; verify ownership checks are present where parsing assumes specific layout; verify relational constraints (` + "`has_one`" + `) for privileged paths. Security here is explicitness. Constraints do not remove responsibility, but they make responsibility visible and testable.

  content: `# PDAs in Anchor

Program Derived Addresses are the backbone of predictable account topology in Anchor applications. A PDA is derived from seed bytes plus program ID and intentionally lives off the ed25519 curve, so no private key exists for it. This lets your program control authority for deterministic addresses through ` + "`invoke_signed`" + ` semantics while keeping user keypairs out of the trust path.

In Anchor, PDA derivation logic appears in account constraints. Typical patterns look like ` + "`seeds = [b\"counter\", authority.key().as_ref()], bump`" + `. This expresses three things at once: namespace (` + "`counter`" + `), ownership relation (authority), and uniqueness under your program ID. The ` + "`bump`" + ` value is the extra byte required to land off-curve. You can compute it on demand with Anchor, or store it in account state for future CPI convenience.

Should you store bump or always re-derive? Re-deriving keeps state smaller and avoids stale bump fields if derivation recipes ever evolve. Storing bump can simplify downstream instruction construction and reduce repeated derivation cost. In practice, many production programs store bump when they expect frequent PDA signing calls and keep the seed recipe immutable. Whichever path you choose, document it and test it.

Seed schema discipline matters. If you silently change seed ordering, text encoding, or domain tags, you derive different addresses and break account continuity. Teams usually treat seeds as protocol versioned API: include explicit namespace tags, stable byte encoding rules, and migration plans when evolution is unavoidable.

For this project journey, we will derive a counter PDA from authority + static domain seed and use that address in both init and increment instruction builders. The goal is to make account identity deterministic, inspectable, and testable without network dependencies. You can then layer real transaction sending later, confident that account and data layouts are already correct.

  content: `# Testing strategy without flakiness

A reliable Solana curriculum should teach deterministic engineering first, then optional network integration. Flaky tests are usually caused by external dependencies: RPC latency, faucet limits, cluster state drift, blockhash expiry, and wallet setup mismatch. These are real operational concerns, but they should not block learning core protocol logic.

For Anchor projects, split testing into layers. Unit tests validate data layout, discriminator bytes, PDA derivation, account key ordering, and instruction payload encoding. These tests are fast and deterministic. They can run in CI without validator or internet. If they fail, the error usually points to a real bug in serialization or account metadata.

Integration tests add runtime behavior: transaction simulation, account creation, CPI paths, and event assertions. These are valuable but more fragile. Keep them focused and avoid making every PR depend on remote cluster health. Use local validator or controlled environment when possible, and treat external devnet tests as optional confidence checks rather than gatekeeping checks.

When writing deterministic tests, prefer explicit expected values and fixed key ordering. For example, assert exact JSON output with stable key order for summaries, assert exact byte arrays for instruction discriminators, and assert exact signer/writable flags in account metas. These checks catch regressions that broad snapshot tests can miss.

Also test failure paths intentionally: overflow behavior, invalid pubkeys, wrong argument shapes, and stale account discriminators. Production incidents often happen on edge paths that had no tests.

A practical rule: unit tests should prove your client and serialization logic are correct independent of chain conditions. Integration tests should prove network workflows behave when environment is healthy. Keeping this boundary clear gives you both speed and confidence.

  content: `# Client composition & UX

Once instruction layouts and PDA logic are deterministic, client integration becomes a composition exercise: wallet adapter for signing, provider/connection for transport, transaction builder for instruction packing, and UI state for pending/success/error handling. Anchor helps by keeping account schemas and instruction names aligned via IDL, but robust UX still depends on clear boundaries.

A typical flow is: derive addresses, build instruction, create transaction, set fee payer and recent blockhash, request wallet signature, send raw transaction, then confirm with chosen commitment. Each stage can fail for different reasons. If your UI collapses all failures into one generic message, users cannot recover and developers cannot debug quickly.

Simulation failures usually mean account metadata mismatch, invalid instruction data, missing signer, wrong owner program, or constraint violations. Signature errors indicate wallet/user path issues. Blockhash errors are freshness issues. Insufficient funds often involve fee payer SOL balance, not just business account balances. Mapping these classes to actionable errors improves trust and reduces support load.

Fee payer deserves explicit UX. The user may authorize a transaction but still fail because payer lacks lamports for fees or rent. Surfacing fee payer and estimated cost before signing avoids confusion. For multi-party flows, make fee policy explicit.

For this course project, we keep deterministic logic in pure helpers and treat network send/confirm as optional outer layer. That architecture gives you stable local tests while still enabling production integration later. If a network call fails, you can quickly isolate whether the bug is in deterministic instruction construction or in runtime environment state.

In short: robust Anchor UX is not one API call. It is a staged pipeline with clear error taxonomy, explicit payer semantics, and deterministic inner logic that can be tested without chain access.
